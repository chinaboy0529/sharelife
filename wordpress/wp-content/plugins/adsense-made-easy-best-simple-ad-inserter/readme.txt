The most simple way to add Google Adsense to your website. Easily insert ads into posts and pages, and you even have some widgets to use.

== Description ==

ADSENSE Made Easy is designed to keep everything as simple as possible. In fact you only need to install the plugin, set your ADSENSE publisher ID in the settings page, and you're done. The ads will automatically appear on your posts and pages. You can even drag a widget into the sidebar if you'd like to have an ad there as well. 

If you'd like to change where the ads appear you can specify the type of ad and the location of the ad by simple parameters in the settings page. You can even change the appearance by changing background and border colors to match the look and feel of your website.
